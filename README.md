# sit223-task6.1p

This is my submission for running a basic Jenkins script to demonstrate simulated stages in a DevOps pipeline. The project template is as follows:

## `environments`

Directories for fetching resources of different pipeline environments.

- `production`

- `staging`

## `src`

The application codebase

## `Jenkinsfile`

This is the script for the Jenkins DevOps pipeline configuration. It reads in the environment variables and prints confirmation logs, simulating a pipeline run with 6 stages. For the sake of demonstration I've logged the env variables to ensure the solution works as intended.
